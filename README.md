# Mental Health in Tech Predictor



A machine learning web application that predicts whether someone may seek mental health treatment based on workplace and personal factors. Built with Python, Streamlit, and Scikit-learn, using a Random Forest Classifier (â‰ˆ80.9% accuracy).

## Project Overview

   ```bash   ```bash

- Predicts likelihood of seeking mental health treatment using workplace and personal data

- Built on OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey (2014)  

- Features 22 engineered inputs from 1,200+ responses

- Provides probability-based predictions and recommendations   

- Works entirely offline â€” no data storage or tracking
